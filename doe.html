        <h2>About the Department of Energy</h2>
        <p>
          The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) was established on August 4, 1977,
          by the Department of Energy Organization Act. The DOE is tasked with
          ensuring America's national, economic, and energy security by
          advancing scientific research and technological innovation in energy
          and nuclear matters.
        </p>
        <p>
          The DOE's mission is to address the nation's energy, environmental,
          and nuclear challenges through transformative science and technology
          solutions. It manages the country’s nuclear weapons stockpile,
          supports research in various energy fields, and promotes the
          development and deployment of clean energy technologies.
        </p>

        <h3>Structure and Leadership</h3>
        <p>
          The Department of Energy is led by the Secretary of Energy, who is
          appointed by the President of the United States and confirmed by the
          Senate. The Secretary is supported by several Deputy Secretaries and
          Under Secretaries, each overseeing different areas of the department’s
          responsibilities.
        </p>
